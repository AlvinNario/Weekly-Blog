            <h1>Week 1 Of On-The-Job Training For StraStan Solutions Corp.</h1>
            <p class="date">February 4 - 6, 2025</p>
            <section class="content">
                <p>The first day covered AWS-CDK fundamentals, including setting up projects, understanding key concepts, and hands-on introductory labs. Participants worked through basic infrastructure as code examples, debugging challenges, and explored best practices for managing cloud resources. The afternoon focused on advanced labs, troubleshooting common issues, and an interactive Q&A session to reinforce learning.
                    The second day transitioned into hands-on AWS service implementation. Participants showcased their To-Do App projects and dived into AWS services such as Cognito for authentication, Lambda for serverless computing, DynamoDB for NoSQL databases, and SQS for message queuing. The day concluded with a practical lab, where attendees applied their learning to build and deploy applications using AWS-CDK.

                        As part of our onboarding and training at StraStan Solutions Corps, our team has been assigned to work on API gateway endpoints and their integration with AWS Lambda functions, DynamoDB tables, and other AWS services. Our primary focus this week is on two major modules: <strong>Marketplace</strong> and <strong>Cards</strong>.

                        <strong>Understanding the Task</strong><br>
                        The goal is to manage categories and sections in the <strong>Marketplace</strong> module while handling schema imports and verification processes in the <strong>Cards</strong> module. These operations involve interacting with API Gateway, triggering Lambda functions, storing data in DynamoDB, and ensuring event-driven processing through SQS queues and EventBridge rules.

                        <div class="module-container">
                            <p>In the Marketplace Module, I’ve successfully implemented category management features, allowing categories to be updated and deleted through PUT and DELETE API endpoints. This ensures that category modifications are handled efficiently while maintaining data integrity. Additionally, I’ve added the ability to assign subcategories to specific sections using a POST request, making it easier to organize and structure content dynamically.</p>

                                <p>
                                    In the Cards Module, I’ve implemented functionality for importing card schemas from CSV files using the POST /admin/cardschemas/csv endpoint. This feature makes it simple to quickly onboard large sets of card schemas without having to manually input data. Additionally, I set up content verification through the POST /admin/listings/verify endpoint, which ensures that the imported data is valid and meets the necessary criteria.
                                </p>

                        We utilized several key technologies and tools to develop our solution. AWS Lambda was employed for backend logic execution, while DynamoDB served as our NoSQL database for efficient data storage. API Gateway managed our endpoints, ensuring seamless communication between services. To handle asynchronous tasks and implement an event-driven architecture, we leveraged SQS for message queuing. Cognito played a crucial role in authentication and authorization, enhancing security. Additionally, EventBridge was used for event processing, enabling seamless integration across AWS services.
                        By the end of the week, we aim to deepen our understanding of API-driven architecture, event processing, and AWS cloud services. This assignment provides valuable hands-on experience that will be essential for our future tasks at StraStan Solutions Corps.</p>
